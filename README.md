# Philip Henrique Puglielli ðŸŒ‹

Hi, I'm Philip Henrique Puglielli, Software Engineer and I currently work creating and executing software architectures, development and migration to the cloud. I've been working with IT since 2018 and I love programming and solving problems. I am a very self-taught person, I love reading and developing very different projects and mixing things I learned in the middle of my studies.

- I currently work as a software engineer in cloud applications using AWS at [Itau Unibanco](https://www.itau.com.br/).

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Kotlin for microservices development and I'm learning most AWS services like EKS, ECS, EC2, Fargate, s2, cloudFront, Lambda, ALB, NLB, among others.
